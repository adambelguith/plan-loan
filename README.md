![Loan Plan Mockup Desktop](./build/public/Desktop@2x.png)
You will build a screen where the user wants to apply for a loan, but before they do that, they want to know how much interest and the monthly installments will be for their loan

In the screen, you will build a calculator in which, the users choose (i) the loan type they want to apply for, (ii) the amount they want to apply for,  (iii) and the number of months to repay the loan.

When the users changes the value of any of the inputs, the monthly installment value, the interest value and the total loan amount is calculated and displayed to them.
